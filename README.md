# uC32-Projects
~~Embedded systems (Pickit 3 &amp; uC32) projects coded with C on MPLabX IDE~~

Programming and building projects with the uC32 Development Kit.

The kit is composed of the Microchip Pickit 3 in-circuit Programmer/Debugger,
the Digilent Basic I/O shield, and the PIC32MX340F512H MCU core.

Code is complied and built on the MPLabX IDE, and is then sent to the I/O shield
and core through the programmer/debugger. Through accessing the ports on the I/O
board, I am able to manipulate hardware events as inputs and outputs of my
program.

The I/O shield consists of 4 push buttons, 8 LED's, 4 slide switches, an analog
potentiometer, and a 128x32 pixel OLED display.

Project List:
1) Basic I/O manipulation
2) Toaster Oven
3) Morse Code Writer
4) Battle Boats Artificial Intelligence
